## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap V5 (https://getbootstrap.com/)

### What I learned

For this project I wanted to try out Bootstrap for the first time and got to see it's strengths and advantages. While there's a lot more for me to learn about bootstrap it was a great experience and I hope to develop better skills and grow my understanding of CSS with these excersises.

During development I used a lot of custom CSS and later tried to achieve the same result in bootstrap, there were some things I couldn't get to do but I hope to gain the knowledge neccesary to deal with those types of problems in the future.

### Continued development
